#### Date: 11/10/2020



### Description
#### Free Web Styles is a platform designed as an open source front-end developer library. It seeks to fost a community of users who value sharing front-end knowledge
#### and create content emphasizing the more functional aspects of stylized HTML/CSS (javascript included soon). Visitors can make use of all posted content, which is made freely available under the MIT license. Registered users can create accounts to share and receive credit for their own html/css "styles", like the content of other users, and code/post work directly in the embedded editor of the main page. Other benefits are planned for contributors in the near future.
